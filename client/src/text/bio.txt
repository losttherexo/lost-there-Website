lost,there is a band from Orlando, FL. created by Andr√© Vargas Roo, lost,there started between the bedroom and the car rides just to drive. brought to life onstage with the help of Xavier Latorre (guitar), Jonathan Reyes (drums) and Karlo Corona (bass), the energizing act provides you an honest blend of nostalgia with a sort of forsaken smile you can't resist. their self-released 2022 EP, "how did i get here?" is available on all streaming platforms.
